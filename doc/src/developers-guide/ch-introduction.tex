\section{What is INET Framework}

INET Framework contains IPv4, IPv6, TCP, SCTP, UDP protocol implementations,
and several application models. The framework also includes an MPLS model
with RSVP-TE and LDP signalling. Link-layer models are PPP, Ethernet and 802.11.
Static routing can be set up using network autoconfigurators, or one can use
routing protocol implementations. The INET Framework supports wireless and
mobile simulations as well.


\section{Scope of this Manual}

This manual is written for developers who intend to extend INET with new
components, written in C++. This manual is accompanied by the INET Reference,
which is generated from NED and MSG files using OMNeT++'s documentation generator, 
and the documentation of the underlying C++ classes, generated from the source files 
using Doxygen. A working knowledge of OMNeT++ and the C++ language is assumed.
